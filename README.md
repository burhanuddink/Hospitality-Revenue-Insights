<h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>
<p>
AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality industry with a legacy of 20 years, operates a chain of luxury five-star hotels across India. However, recent market dynamics and management decisions have posed challenges to their market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segment. In response to these challenges, the managing director of AtliQ Grands recognized the need to harness the power of Business and Data Intelligence to regain market dominance and drive revenue growth. Since they lacked an in-house data analytics team, they decided to partner with a third-party service provider to extract valuable insights from their historical data.

The primary objective of this project was to revitalize AtliQ Grands' revenue management strategy by leveraging data analytics. This initiative aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of their revenue patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making that would ultimately boost revenue and restore their market standing. The project consisted of the following key tasks:

<h4>1. Data Analysis and Metric Creation:</h4>

As the appointed data analyst, I began by thoroughly analyzing the provided historical data. I identified relevant metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that would help uncover critical insights into the revenue generation process of AtliQ Grands. These metrics were designed to provide a deep understanding of revenue streams, customer behavior, and market dynamics.

<h4>2. Dashboard Creation:</h4>
<p>
To make these insights easily accessible and actionable for the AtliQ Grands team, I developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard. The dashboard was meticulously designed to align with the stakeholder's vision, incorporating various visuals, including charts, graphs, and tabular data, to represent the identified metrics. It was created to be an intuitive, user-friendly interface that would empower decision-makers with real-time data insights.

In addition to the metrics and visuals included in the mock-up dashboard, I also went the extra mile by uncovering additional insights not initially specified in the project brief. These insights addressed specific areas where data analytics could drive improvements, such as demand forecasting, pricing optimization, and customer segmentation. By uncovering these hidden patterns and correlations, the project aimed to equip AtliQ Grands with a strategic advantage in the competitive hospitality landscape.
